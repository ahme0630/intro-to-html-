<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>  My name is Shuhd Ahmed. I am 20 years old. I am currently studying graphic design.
last year, I studied Design Foundations, where I learned the basics of design,
including colour, composition, and visual balance .</p>

<p> I am now continuing my studies in graphic design and developing my skills in digital
 tools and creative thinking. I enjoy learning new design techniques and improving my
abilities through practice and projects </p>
